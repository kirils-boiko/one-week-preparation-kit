## What is it?

This repository is designed to aid those currently preparing for HackerRank interview tests as well as to track my own learning process. Specifically, it is aimed at providing my Java solutions source code to [1 Week Preparation Kit](https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/preparation-kits/one-week-preparation-kit/one-week-day-one/challenges) from HackerRank.
